Hi, my name is Anton.

I am a programmer with 4 years of enterprise experience developing, designing, and shipping software written in functional Scala.

Check out my pinned repositories for some projects I enjoyed writing. I also have written some "blog posts" in my [gists](https://gist.github.com/tvoklov).

Outside of programming, I like reading, writing, playing videogames, and taking walks with my dog.

If you'd like to reach me, my Twitter is [@tvoklov](https://twitter.com/tvoklov).

I am available for hire, [here's my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tvoklov).
