Hi, my name is Anton.

I am a programmer with 5 years of enterprise experience. I mainly focus on designing, developing, and shipping software using functional Scala. However, I like exploring other tools, as you might see here. You can check out my pinned repositories for some projects I enjoyed writing.

Outside of everything CS, I like reading and writing, playing video games, acquiring seemingly random skills, and taking walks with my dog.

If you'd like to reach out, these are my socials:

I am available for hire, [here's my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tvoklov).
